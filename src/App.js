              Spearheaded by Subash Dâ€™Souza and organized and supported by a
              community of volunteers, sponsors and speakers, Data Con LA
              features the most vibrant gathering of data and technology
              enthusiasts in Los Angeles.

              Data Con LA began as Big Data Day LA in 2013, with just over 250
              attendees. We have since grown to over 550 attendees in 2014, 950+
              attendees in 2015, 1200+ attendees in 2016, and 1550+ attendees in
              2017. In 2018, we re-branded ourselves from Big Data Day LA to
              Data Con LA. We also had over 1800+ attendees attend. This year we
              expect that tally to be over 2000.
